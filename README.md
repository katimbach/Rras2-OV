# Rras2-OV

This repository contains the R scripts and input files used in the spatial transcriptomics analyses for the paper:

> *ONCOGENIC R-RAS2/TC21 TRIGGERS OVARIAN TUMORS, MALE GONAD DIFFERENTIATION, FOLLICULOGENESIS DEFECTS, AND INFERTILITY*  
> [Add citation/DOI or preprint link here]

The purpose of this project was to study the effects of Rras2-Q72L mutations on mouse ovary phenotype using spatial transcriptomics data (10X Genomics, CytAssist). 

## Repository Structure
- `Scripts/`: R scripts for data processing, QC, and analysis.  
  - Numeric prefixes correspond to the recommended order of execution.  
- `Input_Files/`: Input datasets required to reproduce the analyses.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (or download as ZIP):  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RRAS2_OV_VISIUM.git
   ```

2. **Open R** and set the working directory to the repo root:  
   ```r
   setwd("path/to/RRAS2_OV_VISIUM")
   ```

3. **Install required R packages** (see list below). Example:  
   ```r
   install.packages(c("Seurat", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "cowplot", "stringr"))
   ```

4. **Run the scripts in order** (01 → 11).  
   - Each script may generate intermediate objects used by the next one.  
   - Input files are provided in `Input_Files/`.  

5. **(Optional)** For deconvolution steps, set up a Python environment with  
   [`ucdeconvolve`](https://github.com/dchary/ucdeconvolve) and a valid registration/activation code.

## Notes
- This repository includes only scripts and input files for transparency and reproducibility.  
- Output objects and figures are **not included**; they can be regenerated by running the scripts in sequence.  
- Some scripts depend on output files created by earlier scripts — follow the numeric order for smooth execution.  
- Script 04 to run progeny was run in an array batch job in an HPC with Slurm- the batch script is provided, otherwise the R script can be adapted to instead process the objects sequentially if desired.
